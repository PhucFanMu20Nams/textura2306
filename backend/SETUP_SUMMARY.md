# Textura Web App Setup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the setup process and fixes applied to the Textura e-commerce web application.

## Key Components Fixed

### 1. Database Connection
- Fixed PostgreSQL connection issues by updating credentials in `.env` file
- Created a database check utility script (`check-db.js`)
- Added comprehensive error messages and troubleshooting guides

### 2. Authentication System
- Implemented JWT-based authentication for admin users
- Fixed schema mismatches between models and database tables
- Created admin account management tools
- Protected modification endpoints with authentication middleware
- Implemented standardized API responses

### 3. REST API Completeness
- Ensured all CRUD operations are available for products
- Fixed missing endpoints (UPDATE, DELETE)
- Standardized request/response formats

## Getting Started Guide

### Setting Up the Database
1. Install PostgreSQL if not already installed
2. Set your PostgreSQL credentials in the `.env` file
3. Run the database check: `npm run check-db`
4. Run the migration script: `npm run migrate`

### Creating an Admin Account
Run the admin creation script:
```
node scripts/create-admin-direct.js
```
This will create a default admin account with:
- Username: admin
- Email: admin@textura.com
- Password: admin123

### Starting the Server
```
npm start
```
The server will run on port 5000 by default.

## API Usage

### Authentication
```
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "admin123"
}
```
Response includes a JWT token needed for protected endpoints.

### Product Operations
- GET `/api/products` - List all products
- GET `/api/products/:id` - Get a single product
- POST `/api/products` - Create a product (protected)
- PUT `/api/products/:id` - Update a product (protected)
- PATCH `/api/products/:id` - Partially update a product (protected)
- DELETE `/api/products/:id` - Delete a product (protected)

For all protected endpoints, include the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token
```

## Testing
To test if your setup is working correctly, run:
1. `node scripts/test-auth.js` - Tests authentication
2. `node scripts/test-products.js` - Tests product CRUD operations

## Next Steps
1. Add input validation using Joi or express-validator
2. Implement rate limiting for public endpoints
3. Add better error logging
4. Set up automated testing
5. Document API with Swagger
